Repository contains multi.cpp, the file to be handed in for SESG6025 numerical methods assignment.

multi.cpp solves the 2D Poisson equation with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions and $/Delta^2 u(0.5,0.5) = 2$ with 2nd and 4th order accuracy. Two solvers are implemented: the successive over-relaxation and the red-black Gauss-Seidel. An assumption made is that the step size in both x and y directions are equal.
